# Full_Stack_Blogging_website
Here I have created a full stack blogging website using Python flask microframework for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front end. MySQL and Python SQLALchemy is used for creating and managing the database for updating the Posts and also for receiving messages through the contacts page.
